## Spherical Harmonics as the Angular Embedding $Y_l^m$


* **Spherical Harmonics** $Y_\ell^m(\hat{\mathbf{r}})$
* **Group Theory of SO(3)** (rotations in 3D)
* **Wigner D-matrices** $D_{mm'}^{(\ell)}(R)$

### üéØ What Are Spherical Harmonics?

Spherical harmonics $Y_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$ are special functions defined on the **unit sphere** $S^2$. They're indexed by two numbers:

* $\ell$: **degree** (non-negative integer)
* $m \in [-\ell, \ell]$: **order**

They arise naturally as the **angular part** of the solution to Laplace‚Äôs equation in spherical coordinates, and they form a **complete orthonormal basis** on the sphere:

$$
f(\hat{\mathbf{r}}) = \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} c_{\ell m} Y_\ell^m(\hat{\mathbf{r}})
$$

### üîÑ Rotation Behavior (Group Theory)

The crucial property that makes $Y_\ell^m$ ideal for MACE is **how they transform under rotations** $R \in \text{SO}(3)$:

$$
Y_\ell^m(R \hat{\mathbf{r}}) = \sum_{m'=-\ell}^{\ell} D_{mm'}^{(\ell)}(R)^* Y_\ell^{m'}(\hat{\mathbf{r}})
$$

Here:

* $D^{(\ell)}(R) \in \mathbb{C}^{(2\ell + 1) \times (2\ell + 1)}$ is the **Wigner D-matrix** ‚Äî a unitary representation of SO(3).
* This tells us that the set $\{Y_\ell^m\}_{m=-\ell}^\ell$ **transforms linearly** under rotation ‚Äî they form a **basis for the $(2\ell+1)$-dimensional irreducible representation** of SO(3).

This means the angular part of atomic interactions can be represented using these basis functions and still **preserve equivariance**.

#### üî¢ Part 1: Define spherical harmonics up to $\ell = 2$

```python
spherical_harmonics = o3.SphericalHarmonics([0, 1, 2], True)
```

This uses **`e3nn.o3.SphericalHarmonics`**, which:

* Prepares real-valued spherical harmonics up to degree $\ell = 2$
* `True` specifies **normalization** to orthonormal basis
* Internally, this creates a callable that evaluates:

  $$
  Y_0^0,\quad Y_1^{-1}, Y_1^0, Y_1^1,\quad Y_2^{-2}, \dots, Y_2^2
  $$
* Total number of terms:

  $$
  \sum_{\ell=0}^2 (2\ell + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 = \boxed{9}
  $$

#### üîç Part 2: Evaluate $Y_\ell^m(\hat{\mathbf{r}})$

```python
vector = torch.tensor([1.0, 0.2, 0.75])
print(spherical_harmonics(vector))
```

This computes:

$$
\{Y_\ell^m(\hat{\mathbf{r}})\}_{\ell=0}^2
\quad\text{with }\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{[1.0,\ 0.2,\ 0.75]}{\|\cdot\|}
$$

The result is a **9-element vector** storing all $Y_\ell^m$ values flattened in the canonical order:

$$
[Y_0^0,\ Y_1^{-1}, Y_1^0, Y_1^1,\ Y_2^{-2}, Y_2^{-1}, Y_2^0, Y_2^1, Y_2^2]
$$

These form a **spherical tensor** under SO(3): they transform among themselves when the input vector rotates.

---

#### üîÅ Part 3: Rotate the vector around an axis and track how $Y_\ell^m$ changes

```python
# rotate around [0, 0.7071, 0.7071]
rotation_matrix = Rotation.from_rotvec(i * angle * axis).as_matrix()
rotated_vector = R @ original_vector
```

This creates **360 rotated versions** of the original vector along a 3D rotation axis $\mathbf{u} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0,1,1)$, simulating a **full 360¬∞ rotation in SO(3)**.

---

#### üßÆ Part 4: Apply spherical harmonics to each rotated vector

```python
spherical_harmonic_values = spherical_harmonics(rotated_vectors)
```

Each row of the result contains:

$$
[Y_0^0(\hat{\mathbf{r}}'), \dots, Y_2^2(\hat{\mathbf{r}}')]
\quad\text{for one rotated input vector}
$$

So the full output shape is:

$$
(360,\ 9) \quad\text{(360 angles √ó 9 harmonic components)}
$$

---

#### üìà Part 5: Plot the variation

```python
plt.plot(spherical_harmonic_values.numpy(), label=labels)
```

* Each line on the plot corresponds to one $Y_\ell^m$
* You will see **oscillatory patterns**, depending on $m$
* For example, $Y_1^1 \sim e^{i\phi}$, so its **phase wraps** as $\phi$ increases
* This illustrates the core equivariance property:

  $$
  Y_\ell^m(R\hat{\mathbf{r}}) = \sum_{m'} D_{mm'}^{(\ell)}(R)^* Y_\ell^{m'}(\hat{\mathbf{r}})
  $$

  So the harmonics "rotate" among themselves ‚Äî which is what you're seeing in the changing values.

The key points to note are that the $l=0$ component is constant - it does not change when the vector is rotated.  The other components do change, and as $l$ increases the frequency of the features increases.

#### ‚ÅâÔ∏è What does $m$ represents ?
Absolutely ‚Äî here‚Äôs a cleaner, more concise version of your notes, preserving all the key ideas while making it easier to scan and remember:

* $\ell$: **degree** ‚Äî controls the angular resolution (like frequency).
* $m \in [-\ell, \ell]$: **order** ‚Äî controls variation in the azimuthal angle $\phi$ (around the z-axis).

You always get $2\ell + 1$ values of $m$ for each $\ell$.

1. **Azimuthal frequency**

   * $m = 0$: symmetric about z-axis
   * $m = 1$: 1 oscillation around œÜ
   * Higher $|m|$ ‚Üí more angular variation

2. **Angular momentum** (QM)

   * $m$: z-component of angular momentum

3. **Basis label in SO(3) irreps**

   * Each $m$ is one component in a $(2\ell+1)$-dim SO(3) representation
   * Transforms under Wigner $D^{(\ell)}$ matrices

**üßÆ Example: $\ell = 1$**

| $m$ | Harmonic                       | Meaning        |
| --- | ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| -1  | $\sim \sin\theta\, e^{-i\phi}$ | rotates in œÜ   |
| 0   | $\sim \cos\theta$              | symmetric in œÜ |
| +1  | $\sim \sin\theta\, e^{+i\phi}$ | rotates in œÜ   |

* $m = 0$: rotation-invariant around z
* $m = \pm1$: varies with azimuth ‚Äî you see these oscillate in the plot

### üîó In MACE: Angular Embedding via $Y_\ell^m$

In MACE, for a pair of atoms $i, j$, the model uses:

* Relative vector: $\mathbf{r}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i$
* Unit vector: $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_{ij} / \|\mathbf{r}_{ij}\|$
* **Angular embedding**: evaluates $Y_\ell^m(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij})$ for a fixed $\ell$
