# Chemical Species

**Chemical species** refers to the **type of atom or element** present in the molecular system being modeled.

### ðŸ”¬ Definition in MACE Context:

A **chemical species** typically means a distinct atomic **element**, such as:

* Hydrogen (H),
* Carbon (C),
* Oxygen (O),
* Nitrogen (N),
* etc.

Each chemical species is treated differently in the model because:

* Different species have different nuclear charges,
* They interact differently with neighboring atoms,
* They may have different learnable embeddings (in neural models like MACE),
* Their interactions contribute differently to the energy and force predictions.

> **Example** with a water molecule ($H_2O$) where the molecule is represented with 3 nodes: H (node 1), H (nodes 2) and O (node 3).
> Mace assigns an embedding vector to each chemical species where:


### ðŸ§  In the MACE Architecture:

MACE uses **equivariant message passing** to model how atoms interact. To do this effectively:

* Each chemical species is given a **learned embedding vector**

    - embedding_H = f(H) $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^d$

    - embedding_O = f(O) $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^d$
* These embeddings are used to **initialize node features** in the graph,
* The model learns **how different species interact** under physical constraints (e.g., rotational equivariance using SO(3)).

### ðŸš€ Why It Matters:

Including information about the **chemical species** allows MACE to:

* Generalize across molecules with different atoms,
* Capture species-specific behavior (e.g., how oxygen bonds vs. hydrogen),
* Enable transfer learning to unseen molecules containing known species.

Let me know if youâ€™d like to see how chemical species embeddings are encoded in code or equations in MACE, King Julian.
