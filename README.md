# MLMI-MPhil-Thesis-MACE
This is a University of Cambridge MLMI MPhil Thesis on **Speeding up MACE**

## TODO List

### Open questions

- [ ] It seems that they are hundreds of different Tensor config? which one are we using [torch.Tensor](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html)

### Speeding up

Some GPT suggestions for starting experiments on speeding up inference: [Speeding UP MACE](Notes/General%20Concepts/Speeding_up.md)

### Coding

Coding notes can be accessed in [Tutorial Notes](Notes/Tutorials/T03-MACE-Theory.md)
- [ ] [MACE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace) â€” try to look through the code and train a MACE-small on a subset of a dataset.
- [ ] Running the MACE tutorials #3

### Completed Task

- Run the mace tutorials and did a subproject by evaluating the computation efficiency of each step of the mace schematic
- Read MACE paper and notes
- Main thing to look at is the equivarient MPNNs tensor product (equation 8 in paper)
