This script is a self-contained “precision‐audit” for the two MACE interaction blocks, and it proceeds in four stages:

---

## 1. Model & Data Setup

* **`get_default_model_config()`**
  Defines a minimal MACE model configuration by hand (elements H/C/O, cutoff, number of radial bases, two interaction layers both using the residual block class, irreps for hidden channels, etc.).
* **`data_prep()`**

  * Reads a single geometry from an XYZ file.
  * Wraps it in MACE’s `AtomicData` (building neighbor lists out to 3 Å, collecting atomic numbers and positions).
  * Computes and prints basic stats: how many atoms, edges, the raw position array, node attributes (one-hot element embeddings) and edge indices.

---

## 2. Single‐Block Smoke Test

* **`get_interaction_block()`**

  * Pulls out the first interaction layer (`model.interactions[0]`) and runs a forward pass on the FP64 embeddings, printing the shape of its output tensor $[n_\text{atoms},\,\text{channels},\,\text{Irrep‐dim}]$.
  * This just verifies that you’ve wired up inputs correctly and that the block runs without error.

---

## 3. Precision Comparison Loop

* **`run_precision_comparison()`**

  1. **Collect inputs once in FP64.**

     * `initial_node_features` and `edge_features` are held in double precision.
  2. **For each dtype in FP64, FP32, FP16 (if CUDA):**

     * **Deep-copy** each interaction block (layers 0 and 1) and cast its weights to that dtype.
     * **Forward pass** through the block under test, with `loss = sum(output**2)` (a scalar).
     * **Backward pass** to get gradients w\.r.t. the input node features.
     * Store both the raw outputs and the input‐feature gradients in NumPy arrays (always converting back to FP64 for comparison).
     * Clear GPU cache between dtypes to avoid memory buildup.
  3. **Error metrics**

     * For each lower precision vs. the FP64 reference, compute:

       * **`fwd_max_abs`** = $\max \mid y_{64} – y_{32/16} \mid$
       * **`fwd_mean_rel`** = $mean \mid y_{64} – y_{32/16} \mid / (y_{64} + \epsilon )$
       * **`bwd_max_abs`**, **`bwd_mean_rel`** similarly on the gradients.
     * Prints a little Pandas table showing how forward and backward errors grow when you drop from FP64→FP32 or FP16.
