✅ **Great clarification — let’s break this down and refine your task & prompt!**

---

## 📌 **What your data is**

👉 `db_full = read('...solvent_xtb.xyz', ':')`
➡ This loads 5003 configurations from an XYZ file:

* Each config = a molecular structure (solvent molecules in different configurations)
* Each config contains:

  * Atomic positions (ASE Atoms object)
  * Atomic numbers
  * Possibly energies/forces (XTB computed)
  * Typically several atoms → multiple nodes
  * Many atom pairs → multiple edges

💡 **What this gives you for MACE:**
➡ Nodes = atoms
➡ Edges = pairs of atoms within cutoff radius

➡ The data is perfect for your plan: you have many nodes and edges to stress-test precision.

## 🎯 **Clarified objective**

✅ You want:

* Extract embeddings for:

  * **Node features** (node embeddings)
  * **Edge features** (radial embeddings)
  * **Edge attributes** (angular embeddings / Ylm)

* Save these embeddings

* Run **interaction block forward pass**:

  * With the saved embeddings as input
  * In fp64, fp32, fp16
  * Compare outputs at Neighbour sum + linear
  * No training — just inference

### 🌟 **Prompt**

---

You are tasked with evaluating numerical stability of the MACE *InteractionBlock* using large molecular solvent configurations.

✅ **Objective:**

* Test how floating-point precision (fp64, fp32, fp16) affects outputs of the InteractionBlock
* Use large real-world molecular data (many nodes + edges) to surface numerical instability

---

✅ **Data:**

* Source: `solvent_xtb.xyz` (5003 configs of solvent molecules, XTB computed)
* Use: configurations with large numbers of atoms and edges (select largest configs if needed)

---

✅ **Task:**

1️⃣ **Extract embeddings:**

* For a batch of configs, run MACE embedding code to compute:

  * `node_features_fp64` → node embeddings
  * `edge_features_fp64` → radial embeddings
  * `edge_attributes_fp64` → angular embeddings
* Save these to disk for reproducibility

---

2️⃣ **Run forward pass:**

* For each precision (fp64, fp32, fp16):

  * Convert saved embeddings to desired dtype
  * Run forward through InteractionBlock
  * Capture outputs at:

    * Neighbour sum + linear stage
  * Save outputs

---

3️⃣ **Compare outputs:**

* Compute:

  * Mean absolute error: `abs(output_fpX - output_fp64).mean()`
  * Relative error: `abs(output_fpX - output_fp64).mean() / abs(output_fp64).mean()`
* Aggregate over configs / batches
* Save error metrics

---

✅ **Implementation requirements:**

* Use MACE model components in inference-only mode (no training)
* Ensure consistent random seeds
* Efficiently handle large configs (N\_nodes ≫ 100, N\_edges ≫ 1000)
* Save embeddings, outputs, and error metrics in structured files (e.g. .pt, .npy)

---

✅ **Output format:**

| Precision | Abs Error (mean) | Rel Error (mean) |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| fp32      | <value>          | <value>          |
| fp16      | <value>          | <value>          |

---

✅ **Constraints:**

* No training of the model
* Ensure embeddings are generated once and reused across precision tests
* Isolate precision as the only variable (identical graph structures, same model weights)

---

## 🚀 **End result**

👉 This prompt clearly instructs an AI agent to:

* Identify and save embeddings
* Run and compare forward passes at different precision levels
* Handle your dataset correctly
