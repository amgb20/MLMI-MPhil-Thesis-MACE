### üß© 3. Training MACE

* **MACE** (Higher‚ÄëOrder Equivariant Message Passing) is typically trained with standard float32 via scripts like `run_train.py` (e.g., hidden irreps, batch size, SWA, EMA) ([mace-docs.readthedocs.io][4]).
* No native support exists in MACE for HALP-style low-precision training.

### üîÅ 4. Can HALP enable low-precision training for MACE?

* **Technically feasible**, but you'd need to adapt:

  * Integrate HALP‚Äôs bit-centering and SVRG loops into PyTorch training pipeline that MACE uses.
  * Manage MACE‚Äôs higher-order messages and losses in lower precision (FP16 or maybe INT8).
  * Implement HALP‚Äôs outer-loop full-precision passes and dynamic scaling inside the MACE training script.
* Since MACE training is deep and non-convex, you'll need careful tuning to maintain stability‚Äîbut HALP has shown promise on CNNs and LSTMs ([arxiv.org][5], [arxiv.org][3], [arxiv.org][6]).
* A ready-made HALP implementation exists (in PyTorch) that supports convolutional nets, LSTMs, ResNet‚Äîbut you‚Äôd likely need to **extend it to MACE's model architecture** ([github.com][7]).

### ‚úÖ 5. Recommendation

* **If your goal is experimentation**: HALP is a strong candidate to explore low-precision training for MACE. You‚Äôd go broad like:

  1. Clone the HALP PyTorch code.
  2. Adapt its training loop for MACE.
  3. Compare performance/accuracy vs full-precision MACE.

* **If you need production-level toolchain**: Not yet‚ÄîMACE doesn't include HALP, so you'd need custom design. Another¬†alternative is **mixed-precision training (FP16 + FP32 masters)**, commonly used and well-supported in PyTorch ([arxiv.org][5], [github.com][8], [arxiv.org][3]).
